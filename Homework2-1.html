<h1>Patrick Young</h1>
<p>I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a
<br>programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product
<br>designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for
<br>Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle-from initial product conception through the actual product
<br>launch.
<p>I have a Ph D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on
<br>process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial
<br>Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engi</p>
<p>At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, a sophomore core class, and Software Processes, a graduate
<br>seminar. I also worked as a peer academic advisor, a freshmen orientation advisor, and served on leadership for campus
<br>chapters of both Habitat for Humanity and Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I participate in a variety of activities including

<h4>Classical Guitar</h4>
<h4>Freestyle Figure Skating</h4>
<h4>Keeping Molly, my Cairn Terrier, out of trouble.</h4>
